								<p>Course:
“Build a Simple Android App” by Team TreeHouse takes you through the process of creating an Android App, suggested by Novus Club at Maine East. The focus of the course is to make an app called “Fun Facts” that displays a new fun fact onto the screen every time you press the button at the bottom of the screen. This course however takes you through the process of creating everything visible on the app as well as everything that occurs behind the scenes.

								<p>Course:
“Build a Simple Android App” by Team TreeHouse takes you through the process of creating an Android App, suggested by Novus Club at Maine East. The focus of the course is to make an app called “Fun Facts” that displays a new fun fact onto the screen every time you press the button at the bottom of the screen. This course however takes you through the process of creating everything visible on the app as well as everything that occurs behind the scenes.
 </p>
								<p>IDE:
Everything that we develop for this app will be created through Android Studio. Android Studio is the official IDE for Android, providing the best and fastest tools for developing an Android App. Android Studio provides many tools, such as an emulator for you to test your app as you are creating it to ensure that everything is running properly.
 </p>
								<p>Mission:
The Team TreeHouse course is an amazing way to get started with both Android and Java. This specific course takes you through five steps of creating an app such as the Fun Facts app. First off, the course gets you started with Android, getting you comfortable with the tools and Android Studio. Then, the course takes you onto the look of your app as you start creating the Screen Layout before writing any code to display what you want your app to display. Next, you learn some basic Android Programming called Java that you will use to make your app and buttons function how you want them to. After you finish your code, the course moves onto how you can improve your code and develop your app further. The course finishes off with showing how we can monitor how our app is working or troubleshoot any problems, as well as ultimately testing your app on a real Android phone.

 </p>
								<p>Tips:
Tackle your app piece by piece to make sure it is easy to understand. For example, start by making the simplest version possible. Doing this ensures you that the app is working as expected, and then once you do this you can refine your app to make it more complex.

 </p>
								<p>Know your tools. It is especially crucial to get to know your tools before you begin creating an app and coding. As great as Android Studio is, it is a very complex program and you need to make sure you understand how it works and what tools you can use. If you know your tools, then it is much easier to move along the process of creating your app.

 </p>
								<p>Use your resources and get help when you need it. Android Studio is a great program because it works to help you be most efficient and follow what you are doing. Also, Team TreeHouse provides you with different places to get help, including a community of people where you can ask questions or help others get their questions answered as you all work together towards understanding. Team TreeHouse also provides links to different websites that go further in detail about the specific lesson in the video, so you can get help or further your current understanding.

 </p>
								<p>Do not get frustrated. If you have never worked with Android, there is no doubt that this course will be at least a little difficult for you. Team TreeHouse provides challenges after each video that aim to help you work towards understanding. These challenges are meant to help you comprehend what you are doing or get help when you need it, not to get you frustrated.

 </p>
 <p>Don’t be afraid to make mistakes. It is always okay if you do not understand a concept at first, as long as you make sure you get help and work towards understanding. If you make a mistake, you just need to figure out where you went wrong, fix that mistake, and ensure yourself that you won’t make the same mistake twice. No matter what, you need to work towards gaining understanding.
