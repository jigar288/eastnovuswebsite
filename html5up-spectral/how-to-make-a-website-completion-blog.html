									<p>Looking over the goals for the eight hour long “How To Make A Website” course in Team TreeHouse, it seemed like an extremely arduous task to complete. It is now, after the completion of the course, that I realize how fun and worthwhile the course was in retrospect. The course focused heavily on html and css for creating a website, the two languages I was most comfortable with. The course not only broadened my knowledge of html and css, but made me more comfortable with coding as a whole. </p>
<p>The videos were narrated by Nick Pettit, one of the first teachers to join Treehouse, who has created dozens of courses on web development, game development, and VR. He taught this particular course very well, with lots of explanations and examples. In addition, it also included a myriad of other information about domains, hosting, proper aesthetics needed in a website, how to spot and fix common html and css bugs, and how to properly display a website across multiple platforms. </p><p>
Along with the videos on the course, the course had a linked launcher for you to code along with Nick Pettit. This made the course more interactive and enjoyable, while helping me remember the code better. After every two videos, there was a “code challenge” where I had to regurgitate the code knowledge I was just taught. The code challenges were the only strenuous part about the course initially, because it took me awhile to memorize new coding rules, despite having the launcher to help me with my memory. I quickly realized that if I wanted to complete the code challenges, I needed to rewatch the videos over and over until I not only memorized the coding rules, but I understood how and why they were used. </p><p>
After every section of the course, there was a five question quiz which, fortunately, wasn’t at all difficult. Overall, the course was very much worthwhile to complete. The idea of creating a website has intrigued me for a very long time, and it is very assuring that I now know how to make one using html and css. I recommend this course for beginners who have never written a line of code before. Html and css are very good gateway coding languages and are taught thoroughly with expertise by Nick Pettit in the “How to Make A Website” by Team TreeHouse.</p>
